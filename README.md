# BrighnessVolume_Control
This project uses 3 steps:

  1. Detect Hand landmarks
  2. Calculate the distance between thumb tip and index finger tip.
  3. Map the distance of thumb tip and index finger tip with volume range. For my case, distance between thumb tip and index finger tip was within the range of 15 - 220 and the volume range was from 0 - 100.
  
  One can manage brightness with left hand & volume with right hand simultaneously.
